I am a MD/PhD candidate in the [Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)](https://case.edu/medicine/admissions-programs/md-phd-program) at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and a member of the [Theory Division](https://theorydi.vision) at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Insitute. As a graduate student, my work involves developing models to understand and predict the evolution of resistance in cancer and infectious disease. As a medical student and aspiring clinician, I am interested in leveraging the rich field of evolutionary biology to expand our cancer therapy toolkit.

Hailing from Alabama, I went to undergrad at Washinton University in St. Louis, where I majored in biomedical engineering with a minor in electrical engineering and ran varsity cross country and track and field. I spent a gap year as a research technician in the [Lew Lab](lewlab.wustl.edu) where I studied single molecule imaging of DNA structures.

I matriculated in the Case MSTP in the summer of 2019. In the summer of 2021, I matriculated in the [Systems Biology and Bioinformatics PhD program](https://case.edu/medicine/nutrition/education/phd-programs/phd-systems-biology-and-bioinformatics) at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.

Outside of academia, I like rock climbing, running, and spotting cats around my neighborhood.
